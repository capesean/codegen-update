# codegenerator
Generate code for an Entity Framework 6 / WebApi, with an AngularJS font-end, using Bootstrap 3 or 4.

## Online demo!
A demo of this system is available online at: http://codegenerator.sitedemo.co.za/

You can log into the demo, create your own projects, with entities, fields, relationships, lookups, etc. Then you can view the code that gets generated. (If it's running on your own machine, you can just deploy the code at the click of a button!)

## Blog post
There's a (slightly) old blogpost here, that describes the system in a bit more detail:

## Latest 'project shell'
Note that, to run properly as a project/website, the generated code requires a 'project shell' with the surrounding controllers, stylesheets, directives, packages, etc. 

The codegenerator project itself mostly contains these files, as it's (generated by the tool itself)[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-need-to-go-deeper]. 

However, I don't keep codegenerator's project files fully up to date (I'm not sure how many people are interested in it?), so I just use codegenerator to generate the code to use in other, up-to-date 'project shells'. 

If you're interested in using this tool, get in touch with me, and I can provide you with the latest shell. I'm constantly adding new features (like the 'Use Selector Directive' on the Relationships). That feature doesn't exist in the CodeGenerator shell, but I now use it extensively in other projects.

So if you're interested, get in touch via Github or (Twitter)[https://twitter.com/capesean]. I'd love to know that someone else is interested in using this highly-productive tool!
